# Miwok_App
This is a app which gives us Miwok as well as English translation of words.
This app contains four activity 
* Colour Activity -> It have different colour name in both languages as well as audio sound of miwok translation so that user can understand the pronunciation properly.
* Family Memebers -> It have different Family Members  in both languages as well as audio sound of miwok translation so that user can understand the pronunciation properly.
* Phrases ->It have different Phrases in both languages as well as audio sound of miwok translation so that user can understand the pronunciation properly.
* Numbers ->It have different Numbers in both languages as well as audio sound of miwok translation so that user can understand the pronunciation properly.

With the help of this project I learned variety of new concepts like activity cycle of a particular app, memory consumption by different app, how media player works and how to render from one activity to other.
